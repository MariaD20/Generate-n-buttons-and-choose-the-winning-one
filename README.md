# Generate-n-buttons-and-choose-the-winning-one

In this project I take the input from the user and generate the number of buttons decided by the user.

After this, the user should choose and click a button and a message will be displayed, mentioning if the chosen button is the winning one or not.
The winning button is chosen randomly.

I made this project using HTML and JavaScript.
